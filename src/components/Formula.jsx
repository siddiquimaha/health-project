            <p>The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of pioneering research by Professor Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who redefined
                therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing the use of high-concentration probiotic mixtures to dietetically manage acute and chronic
                gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
            <p>
                His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the intestinal flora’s role was just beginning to be
                understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and
                Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of L’Aquila (Italy).
            </p> 
                
            <p>  He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and book chapters.</p>
            <p>  Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has actively advocated for better regulation and quality
                control of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being risks.</p>
            <p>As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed probiotics have not been clinically tested or may not
                correspond to the original clinically tested formulations when marketed, causing substantial differences in the safety and efficacy of the final product (De
                Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018).</p>
            <p> Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies to ensure that changes in manufacturing processes do not compromise the efficacy and
                safety of the commercially distributed probiotic product.</p>
